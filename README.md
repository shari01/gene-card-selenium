GeneCards Biomarker Score Scraper
This Python script scrapes gene scores for a given list of biomarkers from the GeneCards database using Selenium. For each biomarker, the script navigates to the search results, extracts matching gene symbols and scores, and saves the data in a CSV file. The scraper resets the browser session for each biomarker to ensure clean results and includes error handling for robust execution.
